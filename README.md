❓ Problem Statement

For a hardware manufacturing company, having markets over various cities in India, analyze the sales trend for over a period from 2017 to 2019 and provide key insights.

**My Approach**
* Extracted relavant data from MySQL after doing EDA using SQL
* Loaded the extracted .sql file into Power BI and did Data Wrangling
* As part of EDA, created a Measure table in Power BI to consolidate the Key Measure created. Finally, visualized the findings in a clear and concise Dashboard

**Result**
* The screenshot below shows the dashboard prepared. Please do check the **sales anyalsis.pbix** file.
